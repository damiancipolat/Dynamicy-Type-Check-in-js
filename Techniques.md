# Dynamic type validation techniques
In this file I show several ways to do dynamic type check only using Javascript.

#### What is Dynamic type checking?
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program at runtime. Implementations of dynamically type-checked languages generally associate each runtime object with a type tag (i.e., a reference to a type) containing its type information.

- So we know that in JS don't exists Type checking, and make STATIC type check maybe is'nt the best idea.

I am going to show you three different ways of how to do this, some are simpler than others but you will surely understand all of them.
