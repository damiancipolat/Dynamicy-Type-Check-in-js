# Use type-check
In this file I will show you how to use this module to make type check, but using a third party code.

#### What is type-check?
type-check is a library which allows you to check the types of JavaScript values at runtime with a Haskell like type syntax. It is great for checking external input, for testing, or even for adding a bit of safety to your internal code. It is a major component of levn.

Download it in: https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-check

- So we know that in JS don't exists Type checking, and make STATIC type check maybe is'nt the best idea.

I am going to show you **three** different ways of how to do this, some are simpler than others but you will surely understand all of them.
