# Dynamic Type check in our javascript projects.

Well, I build this repository, because I consider it necessary to give my opinion based on my experience on how it is the best way to **check data types** in our projects using javascript. I think that JS is a great language that today is changing many ways of how to program, all this makes many programmers the lack of a static type checking system in variables at the time of compilation, causes in many people fear and uncertainty on how to handle certain aspects of an application.

There are basically two approaches, using "npm" modules or using the JS "typeof" native function.

#### I'm going to focus on two npm modules:
- Type-check: https://www.npmjs.com/package/type-check
- Fish-type: https://www.npmjs.com/package/fish-type-js (my own NPM custom module :P).
